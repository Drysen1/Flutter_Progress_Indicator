# flutter_progress_indicator

In need of showing progress? For example how many steps a user have left to a certain goal? Maybe you started looking at using some kind of chart plugin or drawing something with Clipath or ClipRect. An easy and quick way of doing so is using CircularProgressIndicator or LinearProgressIndicator and setting the value property. In order to animate we can use a TweenBuilder.
